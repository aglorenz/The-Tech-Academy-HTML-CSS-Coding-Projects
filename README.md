## Large CSS HTML Projects

### Academy Cinemas Website - using Bootstrap  10/16/2018
A follow-along exercise that employs Bootstrap (a front-end component library) to create a mock movie theater website. I'm not happy with how the fixed menu obscures the large banner at the top of the page, nor how it initially obscures the movie posters after clicking Showtimes in the fixed menu.  Will circle around to fix this if I get some spare time.

### Space Travel Website 10/11/2018
A follow-along exercise with a couple slight improvements. This site combines a fixed navigation header, a photo gallery (9 pics), and an input form.  Animations were added to the photos with text overlays and a 110% visual expansion on the photo.  I moved the location of the "Terms and Conditions" element to the same DIV as the SUBMIT button to help it maintain position when the site is scaled smaller. I also found a way to increase the brightness of the input form placeholders using the non-standard placeholder selector ::placeholder.  This may come back to bite me later, but I'm happy I found it.  This exercise helped me gain better familiarity with Visual Studio Code, and Firefox's development environment.
