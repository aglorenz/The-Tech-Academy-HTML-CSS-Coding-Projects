### Space Travel Website 10/11/2018
This site combines a fixed navigation header, a photo gallery (9 pics), and an input form.  Animations were added to the photos with text overlays and a 110% visual expansion on the photo.  I moved the location of the "Terms and Conditions" element to the same DIV as the SUBMIT button to help it maintain position when the site is scaled smaller. I also found a way to increase the brightness of the input form placeholders using the non-standard placeholder selector ::placeholder.  This may come back to bite me later, but I'm happy I found it.
